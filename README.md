Horiseon Home Page

Description
    The motivation for editing this home page was to up the accessibility access on the home page and increase the overall experience for the user. I built this project to fulfill the needs of the clients at the marketing agency. The updated code now is in an organized sequential order to help future programmers who will look at the code. It also ensures all links do what they are supposed to do and all pictures have a tag in the case of a failure of loading.
